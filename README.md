**The Operating System for Campus Management — A modular, scalable platform for managing the complete lifecycle of campus activities.**

---

## 📖 About

CampusOS is an open-source campus management platform designed to replace fragmented tools like WhatsApp groups, Google Sheets, and email for coordinating campus activities. 

Instead of building "just another event management tool," CampusOS provides the **complete infrastructure layer** for campus ecosystems, handling everything from organizational structure to operations to growth.

### Key Problems Solved

- **Coordination Chaos** — Centralized platform replacing scattered WhatsApp groups
- **Manual Operations** — Automated workflows for event management and logistics
- **Data Fragmentation** — Single source of truth for all campus activities
- **Vendor Management** — Streamlined vendor and resource coordination
- **Analytics Gap** — Comprehensive insights into campus activity health

### Who Is This For?

- **Club Organizers** — Easy event planning and coordination
- **Event Managers** — Streamlined check-in, RSVP, and logistics tracking
- **Institute Administrators** — Complete visibility into campus activities
- **Sponsors** — Measurable campaign performance and ROI tracking
- **Developers** — Clean, modular architecture for contributions

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Backend:** [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) + [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) — Fast, lightweight server
- **Frontend:** [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) + [React](https://react.dev/) — Modern, full-stack framework
- **Database:** [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) — Flexible schema for rapid development
- **Architecture:** Modular, plugin-based system with dynamic loading

---

## 🏗️ Architecture Highlights

### Modular Design
Every feature is a self-contained module in `/apps/`:
- Routes, controllers, services, and schemas together
- No direct module-to-module dependencies
- Communication via shared services or database

### Plugin System
- Dynamic module loading at startup
- Enable/disable features per deployment
- Extensible without core changes

### System Layers
1. **Foundation** — Auth, Users, Clubs, RBAC
2. **Event** — Events, RSVP, Check-in
3. **Execution** — Tasks, Workflows, Calendar
4. **Operations** — Vendors, Resources, Budget
5. **Growth** — Sponsorship, Marketing
6. **System** — Notifications, Audit, Analytics
