# ADR 001: Technology Stack Selection

## Status
Accepted

## Context

CampusOS needs to support:
- Modular, plugin-based architecture
- Multi-tenant operations
- Scalability (1000+ clubs)
- Fast development cycle
- Community contributions

Need to decide on: backend, frontend, database

---

## Decision

### Backend: Node.js + Express
- **Why**: Fast development, JSON-native, large ecosystem
- **Advantages**: JavaScript everywhere, npm packages, async handling
- **Trade-off**: Not as performant as Go/Rust for pure computation

### Frontend: Next.js + React
- **Why**: Full-stack JavaScript, SSR, static generation, great DX
- **Advantages**: TypeScript support, API routes, deployment options
- **Trade-off**: Larger bundle size than minimal alternatives

### Database: MongoDB
- **Why**: Flexible schema, JSON documents, multi-tenant friendly
- **Advantages**: Easy scaling, good for rapid development
- **Trade-off**: Less strict schema enforcement than PostgreSQL
- **Note**: Changed from PostgreSQL due to developer familiarity

---

## Rationale

1. **Development Speed** — JavaScript full-stack enables faster development
2. **Community** — Large ecosystem for both backend and frontend
3. **Scalability** — All three technologies scale to our needs
4. **Developer Experience** — Modern tooling and great documentation
5. **Flexibility** — MongoDB allows rapid schema evolution during development

---

## Alternatives Considered

1. **Python/Django** — More concise, but smaller Node.js community for frontend
2. **Ruby on Rails** — Great framework, but declining ecosystem interest
3. **Java/Spring** — Mature, but heavy for rapid prototyping
4. **Go + HTMX** — Fast, but doesn't have the same ecosystem depth
5. **PostgreSQL** — More rigid schema, harder for early-stage development

---

## Consequences

### Positive
- Rapid feature development possible
- Large talent pool for hiring
- Rich package ecosystem
- Good event-driven programming model

### Negative
- Runtime errors caught later (mitigated with TypeScript)
- More memory usage than compiled languages
- Need for careful architecture (dynamic loading risk)
