# 🧠 Copilot System Context — CampusOS

## 🎯 Project Overview

CampusOS is a modular, plugin-based platform designed to manage:

* Clubs
* Events
* Tasks & execution workflows
* Operations (vendors, resources, budgeting)
* Sponsorship & marketing

The system is built using:

* Backend: Node.js + Express
* Frontend: Next.js
* Database: MongoDB
* Architecture: Modular plugin-based system

---

## 🧩 Architecture Principles

1. Everything is a module
2. Modules live inside `/apps/`
3. Core system handles:

   * Authentication
   * Plugin loading
   * Routing
4. Each module must be self-contained:

   * routes
   * controller
   * service
   * schema/model

---

## 📁 Folder Structure Rules

* `/apps/*` → feature modules
* `/backend/` → core server
* `/frontend/` → UI
* `/shared/` → types, schemas

---

## 🔌 Module Rules

Every module must:

* Have `plugin.js` entry
* Export:

  * name
  * routes
  * init()

Modules must NOT directly depend on each other.
Communication must happen via shared services or DB.

---

## 🧠 Humanet Integration

Before implementing ANY feature:

1. Read:

   * `.humanet/problem_statement.md`
   * `.humanet/idea.md`
   * `.humanet/scope.md`

2. Ensure:

   * Feature aligns with scope
   * No unnecessary complexity
   * Ask if you want any clarity related to any implementation or humanet docs

---

## 🚫 Constraints

* Do NOT over-engineer
* Do NOT introduce new architecture patterns without justification
* Follow modular structure strictly

---

## ✅ Coding Guidelines

### Backend

* Use Express routers
* Use middleware for validation
* Keep controllers thin
* Business logic in services

### Package Management

* **Install packages via CLI only**:
  * `npm install <package-name>`
  * `npm install -D <package-name>` (dev dependencies)
* **DO NOT directly edit package.json** for version management
* Use `npm update` for version updates
* Pin major versions, use `^` for minor/patch
* All package decisions must be justified

---

### Frontend

* Use reusable components
* Separate UI and logic
* Fetch via service layer

---

## 🔄 Development Workflow

When implementing a feature:

1. Understand requirement
2. Check Humanet docs
3. Design module
4. Implement backend
5. Implement frontend
6. Connect both
7. Update `.humanet/CHANGELOG.md`

---

## 🧾 Output Expectations

When generating code:

* Follow project structure
* Use clean naming
* Add comments where needed
* Avoid unnecessary dependencies

---

## 🎯 Goal

Build a scalable, modular, production-grade CampusOS system with clean architecture and maintainability.
